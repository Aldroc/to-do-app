taskList.js is now rendering thanks to the renderComponent boolean identifier. A way to render new instances of the taskList component is yet to be found.

Current line of thought is implementing task as an array and new elements are to be concatenated. The map function can then be used to be implement multiple instances of the taskList component. Hopefully.

Implementing task as array worked like a charm! Now all that is left to be sorted are the task counter in the header component and the delete, edit buttons in the taskList component.

Tons of problems have now arisen. So much that I don't want to document them. 

No progress to be recorded either.

Implemented task as a global array successfully. What to do with it is still in the air.
